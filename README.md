# QuickNodes for blender Geometry Nodes
Finding and adding Nodes in the Node Editor can sometimes get very Keyboard heavy and distracting from the flow.
QuickNodes Lets the User add Nodes without using the Keyboard and the Add Menu. 

# Features
- Speed up workflow.
- Add multiple Nodes without losing focus on the required Nodes.
- Perfect for touchscreens.
- Sticky Node Search.
- Access to the Quick Favorites.
- All Panels Closed by Default for a compact view.
- TODO Add Dynamic Groups
- Package as a blender Extension ( I really need help with this )

# Installation
Download the .py file. 
In Preferences > AddOn > Install from Disk.
